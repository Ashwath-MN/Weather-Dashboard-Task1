# Project Description
The Weather Dashboard is a simple and user-friendly web application developed using React.js to display real-time weather information of different cities. The main aim of this project is to build an interactive system where users can check the current weather conditions of any city by entering its name. The application connects to an external weather service (OpenWeather API) to fetch live weather data and display it in a clear and understandable format.
In this project, the user can type the name of a city in the input field and click the search button to view weather details instantly. The system displays important information such as current temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, humidity level, and overall weather condition like clear sky, clouds, or rain. The application updates the information dynamically without refreshing the page, which improves the user experience.
This project mainly focuses on frontend web development concepts such as creating components, handling user input, managing application state, and integrating APIs. React.js is used as the main technology to build the user interface. The project uses React hooks such as useState to manage data and control how information is displayed on the screen. The application also demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API using asynchronous operations.

The user interface of the Weather Dashboard is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to use. The layout is centered on the screen and includes a sky-themed background to represent weather conditions. The weather information is displayed inside a card with eye-friendly colors to provide a better visual experience. The design ensures that users can easily read and understand the information.
An additional feature included in this project is climate advice based on temperature values. The system checks the temperature and provides suggestions for users. If the temperature is moderate, the application indicates that the climate is suitable for outdoor activities. If the temperature is too hot or too cold, it provides safety advice such as staying hydrated or wearing warm clothes. This feature makes the application more informative and useful.
Another important feature of the project is social awareness. When the temperature becomes very high, the system displays a message encouraging users to provide water for birds and animals. This feature spreads awareness about environmental care and responsibility during extreme weather conditions.
